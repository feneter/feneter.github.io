                <p>Do everything (legit) you can to get what you want. Challenges should be your motivation. Always compare yourself to your
                    yesterday's version, are you getting any better?<br>
                    Every person is affected differently by the environment around us, even for two people living together, they are
                    never affected the same. Need to understand yourself better and how you relate to your environment and how you
                    can make use of that for your betterment. (<i>Even peas in the same pod are different</i>)
