                <p>Do everything (legit) you can to get what you want. Challenges should be your motivation. Always compare yourself to your
                    yesterday's version, are you getting any better?<br>
                    Every person is affected differently by the environment around us, even for two people living together, they are
                    never affected the same. Need to understand yourself better and how you relate to your environment and how you
                    can make use of that for your betterment. (<i>Even peas in the same pod are different</i>)

				<p>I used to ask myself at my early age to why people especially my uncles, asking myself to why they are not having jobs?
					Then I got an answer after reaching my 20's. I have gotten the right answer,
					that age does'nt matter in getting money instead everything you plan and do. Then I came across this website
					thus I started working hard so that I become whom I'm destined to be.
